# Knowledge Bot

## Overview

Knowledge Bot is a custom chatbot designed to answer queries using a specialized knowledge base. The chatbot leverages advanced language models for natural language processing, enabling it to understand and generate human-like responses. The project is built with Langchain, Pinecone, Streamlit, and ChatGPT, ensuring efficient and accurate performance.

## Features

- **Tailored Knowledge Base:** The bot uses a custom-built knowledge base, allowing it to provide precise and contextually relevant answers.
- **Langchain Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Langchain to manage the interaction between various language models and the knowledge base.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Implements Pinecone as the vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings, enabling fast and accurate response generation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Utilizes Streamlit to create an intuitive web interface, making it easy for users to interact with the chatbot.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Powered by ChatGPT, the bot excels at understanding and responding to queries in a human-like manner.

## How It Works

1. **Query Handling:**

   - Users input their queries through the Streamlit web interface.
   - The query is processed and matched against the tailored knowledge base.

2. **Embedding Retrieval:**

   - Pinecone stores embeddings of the knowledge base.
   - The bot retrieves the most relevant embeddings based on the input query.

3. **Response Generation:**
   - The retrieved embeddings are fed into Langchain, which interacts with ChatGPT to generate a natural and accurate response.
   - The response is then displayed to the user on the Streamlit interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Langchain:** For seamless integration and management of language models.
- **Pinecone:** As a vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
- **Streamlit:** To build a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
- **ChatGPT:** For natural language processing and generating human-like responses.

## Future Enhancements

- **Extended Knowledge Base:** Expanding the knowledge base to cover more topics and provide even more accurate responses.
- **Voice Interaction:** Integrating speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities for a fully interactive voice-based chatbot.
- **Mobile App:** Developing a mobile version of the bot for on-the-go access and queries.
